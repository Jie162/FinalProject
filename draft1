Question 1: What have I worked on since the start of the project?
Since the start of the project, I have worked on several key functionalities for managing files. I first created a feature to create a file where the user can enter a file name and content, and the program writes the content to the specified file. Next, I implemented a read file function, allowing users to display the contents of a file by entering its name. For file management, I added a delete file feature to remove a file from the system. I also created a rename file function to allow users to rename an existing file by copying its content to a new file and then deleting the old one. Finally, I integrated a queue system where files can be added to and removed from a queue for processing, which is useful for organizing files that need further actions or processing.
Question 2: What am I working on between now and the next draft check-in?
Refine the queue system by adding functionality to process files in the queue and handle cases where the queue is empty or contains invalid files.
Add additional features like filtering files based on specific criteria (such as file type) and implement error handling for more robust user interaction.
Question 3: What issues are blocking me?
I am facing a few challenges, particularly when translating ideas into code. Sometimes I have a clear concept in my head but struggle to express it correctly in code. Other times, I have an idea, but I'm unsure if it is the right approach. Additionally, I occasionally feel uncertain about whether the solutions I implement are good, and I worry that my understanding might be incomplete. This can lead to some confusion while coding and a delay in moving forward with the implementation.
