Question 1: What have I worked on since draft 1 was submitted in your project?

Since submitting the first draft, I have made several improvements to my project. I corrected some errors I had in the initial version, added additional pieces of code to enhance the functionality, and tried to implement the feature to display the queue, although I'm not entirely sure if it's working correctly. I also completed the code to rename files, which was a necessary addition for my project. These changes have helped me refine the overall structure and functionality of my program, making it more aligned with my goals.

  Question 2: What am I working on between now and final project submission?

Between now and the final project submission, my focus will be on testing my code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. I will also work on fixing any errors or bugs that arise during testing. Since adding more code could lead to confusion at this stage, I believe focusing on testing and debugging is the best way to move forward. This will help me ensure the stability and reliability of the project, and once everything is functioning well, I’ll make any necessary adjustments to improve performance or usability.

Question 3: What issues are blocking me?

The issues that are blocking me are similar to the ones I encountered earlier. I often have ideas in my head but struggle to figure out where to start when translating those ideas into code. At times, I worry about whether I’m on the right path or if I’m using the correct approach. Additionally, even though I have written some code, I sometimes feel unsure if I’m making the right decisions regarding the structure or logic, which can create doubts as I progress.
